# Elemental Actions

1) **E01-legal-data**: Write a program that asks the user to enter the following legal data: full name (string), age (int), gender (char), height in meters (float/double), weight in kilograms (float/double), and marital status (boolean value). Then, the program should print each of these values on a new line.

2) **E02-inverted-number**: Write an algorithm that reads a four-digit number and displays the number in reverse order. **Note:** Ensure that the input is an integer, not characters. **Example:** If the number is `4678`, the output should be `8764`.

3) **E03-binary-to-decimal**: Write an algorithm that converts a four-bit binary number to a decimal number. **Example:** If `1011` is input, the result should be `11`.

4) **E04-quadratic-roots**: Write an algorithm that takes the coefficients **a**, **b**, and **c** of a quadratic equation `(ax² + bx + c = 0)` as input and prints the values of x. Assume that the equation always has real number solutions.

5) **E05-clock-angle**: Let's consider an analog clock (with hands). Given the exact time (hours and minutes), write an algorithm that calculates the angle between the clock hands. **Example:** At 3:00, the angle will be 90 degrees. At 3:15, the angle will be 7.5 degrees.

6) **E06-frog-jumps**: José and Pedro are two frogs. José can jump J centimeters and Pedro can jump P centimeters. Assuming both frogs start jumping from the same point (and in the same direction), create an algorithm to determine if the frogs will land on the same point at some moment before José makes K jumps. If they do, determine the first meeting point. **Example:** Suppose José can jump 3 centimeters (J = 3) and Pedro can jump 5 centimeters (P = 5). If José will make a maximum of 10 jumps (K = 10), they will meet for the first time at the 15 centimeter mark before José completes his 10 jumps.

7) **E07-line-intersection**: Given the equations of two non-parallel lines `y = m1x + b1` and `y = m2x + b2`, write an algorithm to calculate their point of intersection.

8) **E08-multiplication-table**: Write a program that displays the multiplication table for a number entered by the user. **Example:** If the user enters `5`, the program should show the table for 5 (5x1, 5x2, ..., 5x10).

9) **E09-pirate-coordinates**: After a maritime accident, a castaway wakes up on a deserted island. While exploring it, he finds a bottle with a scroll inside, which reads: "If you decipher the hidden message, you will find a way to leave this place." On the back of the scroll, there are three 4-digit numbers. After a few minutes, the castaway discovers a Cartesian plane on the scroll and a phrase written with special ink that reveals itself when in contact with water. The phrase reads: "In the center of the triangle, you will find the answer." After reading this information, he realizes that by separating the previous numbers into pairs (x, y) and drawing them on the plane connected by lines, a triangle will be formed. The only task left is to calculate the centroid of the triangle to find the point on the island where the mysterious secret is located. A program is required to simulate the process of deciphering the message, reading the 3 numbers, and outputting the coordinates of the centroid.
