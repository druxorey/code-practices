# Lists

1) **E01-remove-number**: Given a list with arrays of integers and an integer n, implement a function to remove all occurrences of the number n from the list.

2) **E02-mix-lists**: Implement a function `mixLists()` that takes as parameters two lists with arrays of integers sorted in ascending order and returns a new list with the union of both previous lists with their elements sorted in the same way.

3) **E03-circular-list**: Implement a list with an array that simulates a circular list of characters with n positions and given two integers m and i, print m values starting from position i.

4) **E04-recursive-sum**: Build a function that sums the elements of a list with arrays recursively, where the algorithm is called: listArraySize/2 times.

5) **E05-print-list**: Create a function `printList()` using pointers that prints a list L given as a parameter to the function.

6) **E06-sum-list**: Create a function `sumList()` that returns the sum of all elements of a list given as a parameter.

7) **E07-delete-access**: Implement the primitives "Delete" and "Access" of a singly linked list. Define your own node structure using pointers.

8) **E08-even-odd**: Given a list of integers sorted in ascending order, create a function that returns a list with the even elements at the beginning of the list and the odd elements at the end (also sorted).

9) **E09-remove-duplicates**: Create a function that removes duplicate values from a singly linked list of integers.

10) **E10-palindrome**: Given a singly linked list, implement the operation `palindrome()`, which checks if a sequence of characters stored in the list is a palindrome or not.

11) **E11-unique-count**: Given an unordered list A (with repeated elements), efficiently solve the following requirement: Obtain a list B that contains the elements that are in A without repetitions, followed by the number of occurrences.

12) **E12-reverse-list**: Develop two algorithms (one recursive and one iterative) that, given a linear linked list, reverse it without creating a new list or physically moving the elements of the list.
