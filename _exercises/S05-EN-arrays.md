# Arrays and Matrices

1) **E01-max-value**: Write a function that takes an array as input and returns the maximum value in it.

2) **E02-greater-than-n**: Write an action that takes an array A and an integer N as input and returns (using reference parameters) the number of elements in A greater than N and the percentage of elements greater than N.

3) **E03-palindrome-check**: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if it is a palindrome.

4) **E04-even-odd-count**: Write an action that takes an array of integers as input and returns (using reference parameters) the number of even and odd elements in the array.

5) **E05-power-of-two**: Write an action that takes an array of integers A and an element K as input and places K in the power of two positions in the array (1, 2, 4, 8, . . .).

6) **E06-circular-shift**: Write an action that takes an array A of integers and an integer K as input and performs K circular shifts of A to the left. **Example:** If `A = {4, 6, −1, 2}` and `K = 2`, the final value of A should be {−1, 2, 4, 6}.

7) **E07-most-frequent**: Given an array with values between 0 and 100, write a function to determine the most frequently occurring value.

8) **E08-sum-pairs**: Write a function that takes an array of integers A and a number K as input and determines if there are two values in A that sum up to K. **Example:** If `A = {4, −1, 6, 8, 10, 3}` and `K = 2`, the function should return true because −1 + 3 = 2.

9) **E09-merge-arrays**: Given two sorted arrays of integers A and B, write a function to obtain a third array C that contains all the elements of A and B in sorted order. **Example:** If `A = {1, 4, 9}` and `B = {2, 5, 10, 12}`, the result should be `C = {1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12}`.

10) **E10-transpose-matrix**: Write a function that takes a square matrix of N × M as input and returns the transposed matrix of M × N. Remember that the transposed matrix is one where rows are swapped with columns. **Example:** If the original matrix is `A = {{1, 5}, {2, 3}}`, the function should return `A = {{1, 2}, {5, 3}}`.

11) **E11-secondary-diagonal**: Write a function that takes a square matrix as input and returns the sum of the elements of the secondary diagonal.

12) **E12-swap-rows**: Write an action that takes a matrix (with an even number of rows) as input and swaps the even and odd rows. **Example:** If the matrix is {{4, 2}, {1, 2}, {6, −1}, {3, 5}}, the resulting matrix should be {{1, 2}, {4, 2}, {3, 5}, {6, −1}}.

13) **E13-tic-tac-toe**: Create a tic-tac-toe game with the computer. The user must choose which symbol to play with, and the game should end when there is a winner or a tie. The board should be a matrix of size n > 3.
