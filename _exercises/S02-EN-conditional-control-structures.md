# Conditional Control Structures

1) **E01-palindrome-check**: Create an algorithm that prints *“Palindrome”* if a 5-digit input number is a palindrome, or *“Not a Palindrome”* otherwise. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. **Example:** 545 is a palindrome number.

2) **E02-parking-fee**: In a parking lot, the first hour is charged at a rate of $80 per hour (or fraction). After the first hour, each additional hour (or fraction) is charged at $100. Write an algorithm that takes as input the entry time and exit time of a vehicle (24h format) and calculates the amount to be paid. **Example:** If the vehicle is parked for 30 minutes, the charge will be $40. If the vehicle is parked for 1 hour and 30 minutes, the charge will be $130.

3) **E03-interval-check**: Given two values V1, V2 that form a closed interval, and a value X, create an algorithm to determine if X is inside or outside the interval.

4) **E04-bmi-calculator**: The BMI (Body Mass Index) is an indicator of a person's weight in relation to their height. It is calculated by dividing the individual's mass (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters). Write an algorithm that, given a person's weight in pounds (1 pound = 0.453592 kg) and their height in centimeters, calculates their BMI and outputs their weight in kilograms, their BMI value, and the category in which they are classified.

	- Less than 16: Severe thinness.
	- 16 to 16.9: Moderate thinness.
	- 17 to 18.4: Mild thinness.
	- 18.5 to 24.9: Normal weight.
	- 25 to 29.9: Overweight.
	- 30 to 34.9: Obesity class I.
	- 35 to 39.9: Obesity class II.
	- 40 to 45: Obesity class III.
	- Greater than 45: Obesity class IV.

5) **E05-days-elapsed**: Write an algorithm that takes as input a date (day and month) of the current year and prints the number of days elapsed since January 1st.

6) **E06-happy-number**: A 4-digit number is happy if the first two digits are greater than the last two digits. For example, "5612" is happy because 56 is greater than 12. A 4-digit number is increasing if each digit is greater than the previous one. For example, "1569" is increasing because 9 > 6 > 5 > 1. Any number that is both happy and increasing is said to be a very happy number. Any number that is neither happy nor increasing is said to be unhappy. Create an algorithm that takes as input a 4-digit number and prints the type of number found, according to the described classification.

7) **E07-month-name**: Create an algorithm that takes as input a number between 1 and 12 and prints the name of the corresponding month. Consider possible erroneous input values.

8) **E08-quadratic-roots**:Write an algorithm that finds the values of a second-degree polynomial. It should receive the coefficients of the quadratic equation as input. The algorithm must print the roots of the quadratic equation, and if there is no real solution, it should indicate so.

9) **E09-coordinate-converter**: Write an algorithm that converts polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates and vice versa. The algorithm should take as input the desired type of conversion (from polar to Cartesian or from Cartesian to polar) and the corresponding coordinates. For the conversion from polar to Cartesian, the algorithm should take the radius (r) and the angle (θ) in degrees, and return the coordinates (x, y). For the conversion from Cartesian to polar, the algorithm should take the coordinates (x, y) and return the radius (r) and the angle (θ) in degrees.

10) **E10-triangle-type**: Design a program that indicates if three points given by their coordinates (x, y) form a triangle and if they do, it should indicate the type of triangle formed.

11) **E11-triangle-area**: Given three lengths provided by the user, design a program that indicates if they can form a triangle and if so, also calculate and display the area of the triangle.

12) **E12-leap-year**: One way to determine if a year is a leap year is that it must be exactly divisible by four, but if it is a century year (secular year), it must be exactly divisible by four hundred. Create a program that based on the above criteria determines if a given year is a leap year or not, generating an appropriate message.

13) **E13-ork-festive-year**: Ork, the home planet of Mork, celebrates a great planetary festivity every eight years. Similarly, every 72 years Orson's birthday is celebrated and to make it grand, it is also celebrated the following year. However, every 48 years the celebration that could have taken place that year is suspended due to the painful memory of the defeat with their enemy planet in the Impudent Wars. Create a program to determine if a given year is festive. Assume that the counting of the years started in year one.

14) **E14-imaginary-operations**: Create a program that allows the user to perform one of the following operations for imaginary numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The user should be able to select one of the operations, provide the values, and obtain the result.

15) **E15-automorphic-number**: A natural number is defined as Automorphic when its square has the same last digits as the number itself. The first automorphic numbers are 5, 6, 25, 76, 376, 625... Indeed: 5^2=25, 6^2=36, 25^2=625, 76^2=5776.
